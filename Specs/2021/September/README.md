# Innovations for the laptop of the future

**Weight:** a lot heavier than your Apple MacBook lighter-than-air, but with this, you get much higher functionality at a cheaper price (since you don't have to miniaturize all the parts)

**CPU fan:** to combat planned obsolescence, and make it easier to repair the device in the event that the fan were to fail, the fan is a slideout 0.6 inch tray that can be swapped for another one easily.

**Slip control:** The bottom of the laptop is rubberized and is additionally designed to not constantly slip out of your lap.

**Constant ventilation:** 2x 6 centimeter stubs will be on the left and right side of the laptop, so that the fan can always be ventilating through the North and South, even if the laptop is on something that has little ventilation on its own

**High spec:** Due to lessened weight requirements, the laptop can have a much larger battery (1800+ hours on Standby) a much bigger hard drive (over 500 petabytes of storage) and a much more powerful CPU (64 cores, 3.8 Ghz each, 243.2 Ghz total) and more

**Replaceable battery:** No need to grab a screwdriver, the battery cover pops off with a basic lock, and the battery can be replaced without a hassle (provided you have the backup battery with you already)

**Screen:** The screen comes in 1920x1080, 2560x1440, 3840x2180 (2K/4K), and 7680x4320 (4K/8K) resolution, along with touchscreen support, and 32 bit color support (up to 4,294,967,296 colors)

**External ports:** No need for a dongle, external ports are a plenty and you can have a variety of USB ports (USB 2, 3, C, and 4) (between 2 and 32 USB ports total, 2 is the minimum) along with 2 charging ports, an Ethernet port, and any other port you desire

**Charging:** Don't want to plug into a cord? No worry, the laptop can charge wirelessly (inductive charging)

**RAM:** Want to download more RAM? Don't, that would be silly (and it is impossible anyways) this laptop comes with a 1000 gigabytes (1 terabyte) to 8000 gigabytes (8 terabytes) of Random Access Memory, thanks to the bulk rules

**Operating system:** At installation, you can choose between hundreds of different operating systems (whether it be Linux (90+ choices, including Ubuntu, Fedora, Manjaro, Mint, RHEL, Lubuntu, Xubuntu, Edubuntu, ElementaryOS, Kubuntu, Kali (dual boot only) Puppy, ZorinOS, RockyOS, PopOS!, etc.) Windows (3+ choices, including Windows 10, Windows 11, Windows Server 2019, although I am not partnered with Microsoft to do this yet) BSD (8+ choices) Solaris (1+ choices, such as OpenSolaris) or a different system (such as ReactOS) (MacOS is possible, but do so at your own risk, and on your own terms, I recommend dual booting to test this first)

**Durable:** all parts of the laptop are meant to be durable and easily replaceable as part of the hardware longevity standards

**Keyboard:** Enjoy a powerful mechanical keyboard that can type about 50 gigabytes of text with no copy and pasting before wearing out. Each key is estimated to be able to withstand over 60 million keystrokes. If it breaks, it is also very easy to replace. Also, you can choose a custom sticker for the SUPER key upon ordering (the default option is a detailed Linux logo) an optional option for keyboard lighting is available, along with rainbow RGB options. You can also choose different keyboard layouts upon ordering, such as the standard English 106 character set, a Cyrillic set, a Greek set, a Vietnamese set, a Japanese set, an Arabic set, and so on.

**Price:** to be determined

**Weight:** to be determined, aiming to be between 5 and 20 pounds (2.26 kilograms to 9.07 kilograms)

**Processor:** Enjoy a powerful 128 bit processor (with 64 bit processor architecture support) do powerful instructions and natively run the OpenZFS file system

**GPU (Graphics Processing Unit):** To be determined. It is NOT going to be an NVidia GPU, it is likely to be a choice between Intel and AMD

**Internet:** High speed Internet is supported, you can go between 1 bit and 48 gigabits

**SIM card:** SIM card support is optional, your device can connect to cellular networks

**Tablet mode:** 2-in-1 support is still being decided on.

**Touchpad:** Touchpad support is available, with a durable, easy to replace touchpad with physical buttons, including middleclick

**Bluetooth:** BlueTooth is supported
